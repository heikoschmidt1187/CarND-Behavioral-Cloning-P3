1 - general processing like in the videos
  - first training data with one round
  - car drives in right circles

2 - added pixel normalization Lambda
  - decreased epochs to 5 for a better loss
  - loss: 0.4239

3 - implemented LeNet from traffic sign classifier project in Keras and adapted to
    the use as a learning network for automomous driving
  - increased epochs to 10, it's too much but validation loss is at 0.0033
  --> changed back to 4 --> val_loss 0.0011

4 - Augmentation of data by flipping, still bad on driving despite good loss ???

5 - Implemented usage of left and right image + steering measurment correction
    factor of 0.2
  - val_loss = 0.003
  - better, not one full round, but first turns are taken slooowly but right :-D
